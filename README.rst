===================================
Sphinx Traceability plugin - README
===================================

Sphinx plugin that allows defining documentation items and relations between those items. Can be used
as a requirements management tool for e.g. ISO26262 projects.

.. _traceability_goal:

----
Goal
----

Define documentation items which can be linked to each other. E.g. define requirements which can be derived from
other requirements, or linked to design items and test case descriptions.

Every item is an object in the documentation, which can have different relations to other objects in the documentation.
Documentation objects can be spread in different documents.

Two kinds of relationships exist:

- Internal relationships: Relationships between objects of the documentation (items). Once a (forward) relationship
  from item A to item B is defined, the reverse relationship from item B to item A is
  automatically generated by the plugin.

- External relationships: Relationship from an object of the documentation (item), to an external reference (url of
  e.g. an external tool). As no item B exists, the reverse relationship is also not defined.

Relationship are configurable.

The plugin can generate

- rendered versions of the defined documentation objects
- flat lists of documentation objects
- traceability matrices between objects

.. _traceability_installing:

----------
Installing
----------

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install mlx.traceability

.. _traceability_config:

-------------
Configuration
-------------

The *conf.py* file contains the documentation configuration for your project. This file needs to be equipped in order
to configure the traceability plugin.

First the plugin needs to be enabled in the *extensions* variable:

.. code-block:: bash

    extensions = [
        'mlx.traceability.traceability',
        ...
    ]

Second the path to the static javascript assets needs to be added to the sphinx ``html_static_path``
variable.

.. code-block:: bash

    import os
    import mlx.traceability

    html_static_path = [os.path.join(os.path.dirname(mlx.traceability.__file__), 'assets')]

.. _traceability_config_attributes:

Valid attributes
================

Python variable *traceability_attributes* can be defined in order to override the
default configuration of the traceability plugin.
It is a *set* of attribute pairs: the *key* is the name of the attribute (can only be lowercase),
while the *value* holds the regular expression to which the attribute-value should comply.

Example of attributes and their regular expression:

.. code-block:: python

    traceability_attributes = {
        'value': '^.*$',
        'asil': '^(QM|[ABCD])$',
    }

.. _traceability_config_attribute2string:

Stringification of attributes
================================

Python variable *traceability_attribute_to_string* can be defined in order to override the
default configuration of the traceability plugin.
It is a *set* of attribute stringifications: the *key* is the name of the attribute, while
the *value* holds the string representation (as to be rendered in html) of the attribute name.

Example of attribute stringification:

.. code-block:: python

    traceability_relationship_to_string = {
        'value': 'Value',
        'asil': 'ASIL',
    }

.. _traceability_config_relations:

Valid relationships
===================

Python variable *traceability_relationsips* can be defined in order to override the
default configuration of the traceability plugin.
It is a *set* of relationship pairs: the *key* is the name of the forward relationship, while the *value* holds the
name of the corresponding reverse relationship. Both can only be lowercase.

Relationships with prefix *ext_* are threated in a different way: they are handled as external relationships and don't
need a reverse relationship.

Example of internal and external relationship pairs:

.. code-block:: python

    traceability_relationships = {
        'validates': 'validated_by',
        'ext_polarion_reference': ''
    }

.. _traceability_config_relation2string:

Stringification of relationships
================================

Python variable *traceability_relationship_to_string* can be defined in order to override the
default configuration of the traceability plugin.
It is a *set* of relationship stringifications: the *key* is the name of the (forward or reverse) relationship, while
the *value* holds the string representation (as to be rendered in html) of the relationship.

Example of internal and external relationship stringification:

.. code-block:: python

    traceability_relationship_to_string = {
        'validates': 'Validates',
        'validated_by': 'Validated by',
        'ext_polarion_reference': 'Polarion reference'
    }

.. _traceability_config_ext2url:

External relationship to URL translation
========================================

External relationships need to be translated to URL's while rendering. For each defined external relationship,
an entry in the Python *set* named *traceability_external_relationship_to_url* is needed. The URL generation
is templated using the *fieldx* keyword, where x is a number incrementing from 1 onwards for each value in the URL
that needs to be replaced.

Example configuration of URL translation of external relationship using 2 fields:

.. code-block:: python

    traceability_external_relationship_to_url = {
        'ext_polarion_reference': 'https://melexis.polarion.com/polarion/#/project/field1/workitem?id=field2',
    }

.. _traceability_config_render_relations:

Rendering of relationships per documentation object
===================================================

When rendering the documentation objects, the user has the option to include/exclude the rendering of the
relationships to other documentation objects. This can be done through the Python variable
*traceability_render_relationship_per_item* which is *boolean*: a value of 'True' will enable rendering
of relationships per documentation object, while a value of 'False' will disable this rendering.

Example configuration of enable rendering relationships per item:

.. code-block:: python

    traceability_render_relationship_per_item = True

Rendering of attributes per documentation object
================================================

The rendering of attributes of documentation objects can be controlled through the *boolean* variable
*traceability_render_attributes_per_item*: rendering of attributes is enabled by setting it to 'True' (the default)
while a value of 'False' will prevent the attribute list from being rendered.

Example configuration of disabling per item attribute rendering:

.. code-block:: python

    traceability_render_attributes_per_item = False

.. _traceability_config_no_captions:

No captions
===========

By default, the output will contain hyperlinks to all related items. By default the caption for the target
item is displayed for each of the related items. The captions can be omitted at configuration level (see
this section) and at directive level (see e.g. `traceability_usage_item_matrix`_).

No captions for item
--------------------

Example configuration of disabling the rendering of captions on item:

.. code-block:: python

    traceability_item_no_captions = True

No captions for item-list
-------------------------

Example configuration of disabling the rendering of captions on item-list:

.. code-block:: python

    traceability_list_no_captions = True

No captions for item-matrix
---------------------------

Example configuration of disabling the rendering of captions on item-matrix:

.. code-block:: python

    traceability_matrix_no_captions = True

No captions for item-attributes-matrix
--------------------------------------

Example configuration of disabling the rendering of captions on item-attributes-matrix:

.. code-block:: python

    traceability_attributes_matrix_no_captions = True

No captions for item-tree
-------------------------

Example configuration of disabling the rendering of captions on item-tree:

.. code-block:: python

    traceability_tree_no_captions = True

.. _traceability_config_export:

Export
======

The plugin allows exporting the documentation items.

Export to JSON
--------------

As a preliminary test feature, the plugin allows to export the documentation items to a JSON database. The feature
can be enabled by setting the configuration to your JSON-file to export to. Note, the JSON-file is overwritten
(not appended) on every build of the documentation.

.. code-block:: python

    traceability_json_export_path = '/path/to/your/database.json'

As a preliminary feature, the database only contains per documentation item:

- the id,
- the caption,
- the document name and line number,
- the relations to other items.

The actual content (RST content with images, formulas, etc) of the item is currently not stored.

.. note:: Requires sphinx >= 1.6.0

.. _traceability_config_callback:

Callback per item (advanced)
============================

The plugin allows parsing and modifying documentation objects 'behind the scenes' using a callback. The callback
has this prototype:

.. code-block:: python

    def traceability_my_callback_per_item(name, all_items):
        '''
        Custom callback on items

        :param name: Name (id) of the item currently being parsed
        :param all_items: Set of all items that are parsed so far
        '''
        return

The callback is executed while parsing the documentation item from your rst-file. Note that not all items are
available at the time this callback executes, the *all_items* parameter is a growing set of documentation objects.

Example of no callback per item:

.. code-block:: python

    traceability_callback_per_item = None

.. _traceability_default_config:

Default config
==============

The plugin itself holds a default config that can be used for any traceability documenting project:

.. code-block:: python

    traceability_callback_per_item = None
    traceability_attributes = {
        'value': '^.*$',
        'asil': '^(QM|[ABCD])$',
        'aspice': '^[123]$',
        'status': '^.*$'
    }
    traceability_attribute_to_string = {
        'value': 'Value',
        'asil': 'ASIL',
        'aspice': 'ASPICE',
        'status': 'Status'
    }
    traceability_relationships = {
        'fulfills': 'fulfilled_by',
        'depends_on': 'impacts_on',
        'implements': 'implemented_by',
        'realizes': 'realized_by',
        'validates': 'validated_by',
        'trace': 'backtrace',
        'ext_toolname': ''
    }
    traceability_relationship_to_string = {
        'fulfills': 'Fulfills',
        'fulfilled_by': 'Fulfilled by',
        'depends_on': 'Depends on',
        'impacts_on': 'Impacts on',
        'implements': 'Implements',
        'implemented_by': 'Implemented by',
        'realizes': 'Realizes',
        'realized_by': 'Realized by',
        'validates': 'Validates',
        'validated_by': 'Validated by',
        'trace': 'Traces',
        'backtrace': 'Back traces',
        'ext_toolname': 'Referento to toolname'
    }
    traceability_external_relationship_to_url = {
        'ext_toolname': 'http://toolname.company.com/field1/workitem?field2'
    }
    traceability_render_relationship_per_item = False

This default configuration build into the plugin, can be overriden through the conf.py of your project.

For Melexis.SWCC silicon projects, the SWCC process holds a default configuration in the *config/traceability_config.py* file.
For each of the above configuration variables, the default configuration file holds a variable with *swcc_* prefix.
Taking the default configuration is as easy as assiging the above configuration value with the *swcc_* variable.
Overriding a configuration is as easy as assigning your own values to a configuration value.

Example of accepting default configuration for relationships, while disabling (override) rendering of relationships
per documentation object:

.. code-block:: python

    sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('<path_to_process_submodule>/config'))

    from traceability_config import swcc_traceability_attributes
    from traceability_config import swcc_traceability_relationships
    from traceability_config import swcc_traceability_relationship_to_string

    traceability_attributes = swcc_traceability_attributes
    traceability_relationships = swcc_traceability_relationships
    traceability_relationship_to_string = swcc_traceability_relationship_to_string
    traceability_render_relationship_per_item = False

.. _traceability_usage:

-----
Usage
-----

.. _required_sphinx_options:

Required sphinx options
=======================

By default sphinx (*sphinx-build*) performs an incremental build: it only parses the changed files, and generates
new output for changed files. As this plugin generates automatic reverse relations, the incremental build option
of sphinx needs to be disabled. This can be done using the *-E* option:

.. code-block:: bash

    sphinx-build -E <other_options>

:Rationale: The plugin allows linking documentation items through relations. If a forward relation from *item-A*
            (in *document-a.rst*) to *item-B* (in *document-b.rst*) is created, the reverse relations from
            *item-B* to *item-A* is automatically created. With incremental builds, documents only get re-generated
            when they are changed. This means the automatic reverse relation cannot be created if that *document-B*
            was not touched.
            By disabling incremental builds, it is made sure every document is updated (with automatic reverse
            relations) on every re-build.

The plugin assumes incremental builds are disabled, as this makes the implementation of the plugin much easier.

.. _traceability_usage_item:

Defining documentation items
============================

Documentation items can be defined using the *item* directive, specifying:

- the name (id) of the documentation item
- caption or short description of the documentation item
- attributes for the documentation item
- internal/external relationships to other documentation items (details in next paragraph)
- content of documentation item including any rst content including text, images, formulas, code-blocks, etc.

.. code-block:: rest

    .. item:: SWRQT-MY_FIRST_REQUIREMENT Caption of my first requirement
        :value: 400
        :status: Approved
        :validated_by: ITEST-MY_FIRST_INTEGRATION_TEST
        :ext_polarion_reference: project_x:workitem_y
        :nocaptions:

        According to the Polarion reference, the software **shall** implement my first requirement.

Attributes can be added to the item, using the `configured attribute keys <traceability_default_config>`_
(e.g. *value* in the above example). The content of the attribute is threated as a single string and should
match the regular expression in configuration.

The relations to other documentation items can be specified as:

- a space seperated list of item ID's, or
- items can be linked to on a newline (tabulated)

.. code-block:: rest

    .. item:: SWRQT-MY_FIRST_REQUIREMENT Caption of my first requirement
        :validated_by:
            ITEST-MY_FIRST_INTEGRATION_TEST
            ITEST-MY_SECOND_INTEGRATION_TEST

The output will contain hyperlinks to all related items. By default the caption for the target item is displayed for
each of these related items. With the option *nocaptions* these captions can be omited.

.. _adding_relations:

Adding relations outside of the item definitions
================================================

In some cases, it's useful to add relations outside of the definition of the items
involved. In that case, you can use the ``item-link`` directive as follows

.. code-block:: rest

    .. item-link::
        :sources: RQT1 RQT2
        :targets: TST3 TST4 TST5
        :type: validates

This directive has no representation in the documentation build output. It will
just add an additional relationship to the items mentioned in ``sources`` and
``targets``

Adding description to attributes
================================

Section `traceability_config_attributes`_ explain how attributes can be added to the configuration. It is possible
to add content to the attributes. A detailed description can be added to a attribute definition:

- the name (id) of the attribute, needs to match the configured attribute. This name is not case sensitive.
- caption or short description of the attribute
- content of attribute including any rst content including text, images, formulas, code-blocks, etc.

.. code-block:: rest

    .. item-attribute:: status The status of a requirement

        The status of the requirement explains whether it is *draft*, *under-review*, *approved* or *invalid*.

.. _traceability_usage_item_linking:

Manual link to documentation items
==================================

Manual links in RST documentation to any of the documentation items is possible using the *:item:* role:

.. code-block:: rest

    For validating the :item:`SWRQT-MY_FIRST_REQUIREMENT`, we plan to use setup x in the y configuration.

.. _traceability_usage_item_list:

Flat list of documentation items
================================

A flat list of documentation items can be generated using a python regular expression filter:

.. code-block:: rest

    .. item-list:: All software requirements
        :filter: SWRQT
        :status: Appr
        :nocaptions:

where *SWRQT* (*filter* argument) can be replaced by any python regular expression. Documentation items matching
their ID to the given regular expression end up in the list.

where *status* can be replaced by any configured attribute, and *Appr* can be replaced by any python regular
expression. Documentation items where the *status* attribute matches the given regular expression end up in the list.

By default the caption for every item in the list is shown. By providing the *nocaptions* flag, the
caption can be omitted. This gives a smaller list, but also less details.

.. _traceability_usage_item_attributes_matrix:

Matrix with attributes of documentation items
=============================================

A matrix listing the attributes of documentation items can be generated using:

.. code-block:: rest

    .. item-attributes-matrix:: Attributes for requirements
        :filter: SWRQT
        :status: Appr
        :attributes: status
        :sort: status
        :reverse:
        :nocaptions:

where the *filter* argument can be replaced by any python regular expression. Documentation items matching
their ID to the given regular expression end up in the list.

where *status* can be replaced by any configured attribute, and *Appr* can be replaced by any python regular
expression. Documentation items where the *status* attribute matches the given regular expression end up in the list.

where *attributes* argument is a space-separated list of attributes that should be matched in the matrix.

Above arguments can be avoided, or left empty, in which case the table will contain all attributes for all
documentation items.

Documentation items matching their ID to the given *filter* regular expression end up in as rows in the
generated table. The matching attribute values end up as columns in the generated table. Documentation items
that don't have a value for a certain attribute will have an empty cell at the corresponding location.

By default the caption for every item in the table is shown. By providing the *nocaptions* flag, the
caption can be omitted. This gives a smaller table, but also less details.

By default items are sorted based on their name. With the *sort* argument it is possible to sort on one
or more attribute values. When providing multiple attributes on which to sort, the attribute keys are
space separated. The sorting is a natural sort. With the *reverse* argument, the sorting is reversed.

Optionally, the *class* attribute can be specified, to customize table output, especially useful when rendering to
LaTeX.  Normally the *longtable* class is used when the number of rows is greater than 30 which allows long tables to
span multiple pages. By setting *class* to *longtable* manually you can force the use of this environment.

.. _traceability_usage_item_matrix:

Traceability matrix of documentation items
==========================================

A traceability matrix of documentation items can be generated using:

.. code-block:: rest

    .. item-matrix:: Requirements to test case description traceability
        :source: SWRQT
        :target: [IU]TEST
        :status: Appr
        :sourcetitle: Software requirements
        :targettitle: Integration and unit test cases
        :type: validated_by
        :nocaptions:
        :stats:

where the *source* and *target* arguments can be replaced by any python regular expression.

where *status* can be replaced by any configured attribute, and *Appr* can be replaced by any python regular
expression. Only documentation items where the *status* attribute matches the given regular expression end up in
the *source* part of the matrix. The attribute value is **not** used as a filter on the *target* part.

The *type* argument
is a space-separated list of relationships that should be matched in the matrix. The *sourcetitle* and *targettitle*
arguments are the titles of the columns in the generated matrix.

Documentation items matching their ID to the given *source* regular expression end up in the left column of the
generated table. Documentation items matching their ID to the given *target* regular expression with a matching
relationship (see *type* argument) will end up in the right column of the generated table.

By default the caption for every item in the table is shown. By providing the *nocaptions* flag, the
caption can be omitted. This gives a smaller table, but also less details.

By providing the *stats* flag, some statistics (coverage percentage) are calculated and displayed above the
matrix. The plugin counts the number of items having a target item in the target-column (=covered or allocated),
and the number of items having no target in the target-column (=not covered or allocated). And calculates a
coverage/allocation percentage from these counts. If the *stats* flag is not given, this percentage is not
displayed.

Optionally, the *class* attribute can be specified, to customize table output, especially useful when rendering to
LaTeX.  Normally the *longtable* class is used when the number of rows is greater than 30 which allows long tables to
span multiple pages. By setting *class* to *longtable* manually you can force the use of this environment.

.. _traceability_usage_2d_matrix:

2D-matrix of documentation items
================================

A 2D-matrix of documentation items can be generated using:

.. code-block:: rest

    .. item-2d-matrix:: Requirements to test case description traceability
        :source: SWRQT
        :target: [IU]TEST
        :status: Appr
        :hit: x
        :miss:
        :type: validated_by

where the *source* and *target* arguments can be replaced by any python regular expression.

where *status* can be replaced by any configured attribute, and *Appr* can be replaced by any python regular
expression. Only documentation items where the *status* attribute matches the given regular expression end up in
the *source* part of the matrix. The attribute value is **not** used as a filter on the *target* part.

The *type* argument is a space-separated list of relationships that should be matched in the matrix.

Documentation items matching their ID to the given *source* regular expression end up as columns of the
generated table. Documentation items matching their ID to the given *target* regular expression end up as
rows of the generated table. Where source and target items have a matching relationship (see *type* argument)
an 'x' will be placed in the cell at co-ordinates of source/target.

Captions for items in the 2D table are never shown, as it would give a too heavy loaded table.

Optionally, the *class* attribute can be specified, to customize table output, especially useful when rendering to
LaTeX.  Normally the *longtable* class is used when the number of rows is greater than 30 which allows long tables to
span multiple pages. By setting *class* to *longtable* manually you can force the use of this environment.

.. _traceability_usage_item_tree:

Documentation items tree-view
=============================

Note: this feature is not supported when building for latex/pdf.

A tree-view of documentation items can be generated using:

.. code-block:: rest

    .. item-tree:: Requirements tree view
        :top: SWRQT
        :top_relation_filter: depends_on
        :status: Appr
        :type: impacts_on validated_by
        :nocaptions:

where the *top* argument can be replaced by any python regular expression. The *top_relation_filter* and *type* arguments
are space-separated lists of relationships.

The directive generates an expandable tree of links to documentation items. A nested bullet list is generated
with at the top level, the top level documentation items. These are the ones matching their ID to the *top*
regular expression, and not having any relation of *top_relation_filter* kind to a documentation item matching the same
*top* regular expression against its ID.

The *status* can be replaced by any configured attribute, and *Appr* can be replaced by any python regular
expression. Only documentation items where the *status* attribute matches the given regular expression end up in
the tree.

Going deeper down this nested bullet list, the items relationships are checked: if there is a *type*
relationship (*type* is a space seperated list of relationships) it gets added as a one-level-deeper item in
the nested bullet list. This action is repeated recursively.

.. warning::

    The *type* is a list of relationships, which cannot hold the forward and reverse relationship of a pair.
    This would give endless repetition of the same nesting, and an endless recursion in python. The plugin
    checks the *item-tree* directives for this mistake!

By default the caption for every item in the tree is shown. By providing the *nocaptions* flag, the
caption can be omitted. This gives a smaller tree, but also less details.

.. _traceability_process:

Process

The Melexis.SWCC process has a Guideline for documenting in Restructured Text (RST). It holds guidelines for using
the traceability plugin with naming conventions, templates, etc.
